    This is the main class for handling Mud Telnet connections. It can be used as-is, or subclassed.
    It's meant to be used with an asyncio. It doesn't provide any networking capabilities itself, however.

    Using it involves primarily the following methods:
    - async def start(self): This should be called first thing after hooking it up to any networking code. It will initiate
        any Telnet Option negotiations and provides a list of asyncio.Events that can be awaited on to determine when the
        negotiations are complete. We recommend a timeout on this, since many clients don't do anything with Telnet Options.
    - async def receive_data(self, data: bytes) -> int: This is the main entry point for incoming data. Just dump all incoming bytes
        into this method, and it will handle the rest.
    - async def send_text(self, text: str): This is the main method for sending text to the client. It will automatically
        convert and encode the text as needed. There are also send_mssp, send_gmcp, and send_line methods.
    - async def output_stream(self): This is an async generator that yields bytes to be sent to the client. It should be used
        in an async for loop. It's the main output mechanism.
    - callbacks: This is a dictionary of callbacks that can be set to handle various events. The keys are "line", "command",
        and "change_capabilities". The values should be async callables that accept the appropriate arguments. Just
        check out how they're called in the code to see what they should look like.
